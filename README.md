# Sock

Sock is a tool that allows for easy and intuitive editing of Yarn Dialogue (.yarn files). \
Itâ€™s based around the node System xNode which allows it to present data in a user-friendly manner. \
After writing dialogue you can preview it directly in the editor. \
\
The tool currently only supports simple dialogue, choices and no yarn variables.
\
The unitypackage and the documentation are both in the Release .zip.\
